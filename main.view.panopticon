The shipping industry is under pressure to reduce its environmental impact, with regulations such as IMO 2020 mandating the use of cleaner fuels. However, the transition to low-carbon technologies remains slow due to cost and infrastructure challenges. In the meantime, companies are exploring alternative options such as carbon offsets and slow-steaming. The push towards sustainability is not only driven by regulatory compliance but also by consumer demand for eco-friendly products and supply chains. Overall, the industry faces a complex challenge in balancing economic growth with environmental responsibility.\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/default.css\">","behaviour":"sandbox"},"type":"HTML","uuid":"440081be-871f-4416-be33-da42d9304438"}],"tiles":{"direction":"row","first":"6e61dedb-af6e-4528-ae8a-58530e0c726b","second":"440081be-871f-4416-be33-da42d9304438","splitPercentage":64.99162479061977},"presets":[{"uuid":"48c9cc49-da18-455f-a303-cc65fb97e4ce","name":"Default Search","preset":{"query":{"value":null,"label":"Location","placeholder":"Tanger","default":""}}},{"uuid":"3817066e-7a2d-4c9c-9784-c056c3c660e7","name":"Advanced","preset":{"query":{"value":null,"label":"Location","placeholder":"Tanger","default":""},"classes":{"value":null,"label":"Classes","placeholder":"Cargo","default":""},"type":{"value":null,"label":"Type","placeholder":"Sea","default":""}}}],"services":[{"parameters":{"title":"Nominatim","url":"{{#query}}https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?q={{query}}&format=json{{/query}}","method":"GET","headers":"[{\"key\":\"User-Agent\",\"value\":\"geosearch-example\"}]","body":"","output":"nominatim"},"type":"HttpRequest","uuid":"2d3ee403-5040-460d-aa46-ac4577d1c9fd"}]}
