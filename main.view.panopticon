The shipping industry is under pressure to reduce its environmental impact, with regulations such as IMO 2020 mandating the use of cleaner fuels. However, the transition to low-carbon technologies remains slow due to cost and infrastructure challenges. In the meantime, companies are exploring alternative options such as carbon offsets and slow-steaming. The push towards sustainability is not only driven by regulatory compliance but also by consumer demand for eco-friendly products and supply chains. Overall, the industry faces a complex challenge in balancing economic growth with environmental responsibility.\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/default.css\">","behaviour":"sandbox"},"type":"HTML","uuid":"440081be-871f-4416-be33-da42d9304438"}],"tiles":{"direction":"row","first":"6e61dedb-af6e-4528-ae8a-58530e0c726b","second":"440081be-871f-4416-be33-da42d9304438","splitPercentage":64.99162479061977},"presets":[],"services":[]}
